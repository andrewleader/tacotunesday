# Plywood

Everything is built using 1/4" and 1/2" plywood.

The floor is 1/4" marine plywood, see the [flooring section](./flooring.md) for more details.

The cabinets / countertop / table / seats are built using **[Ultralight Plywood](https://ultralightply.com/)**, which is quite a bit lighter than Baltic Birch. Their 1/2" plywood is significantly lighter, which was nice since I could stress less about the weight and use 1/2" for most of it.

The seats are exclusively built with 1/2".

The table and counter are 1/2" plywood, then stained and sealed.

The cabinets are primarily all 1/2" plywood except the one front side piece at the entrance of the vehicle.

The drawers are 1/2" plywood bases with 1/4" plywood sides and faces.
