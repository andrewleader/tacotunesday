# Drawers

The drawers are built using 1/2" plywood on the base, and 1/4" plywood sides and 1/4" plywood front, and the wood is simply glued together with simple butt joints.

## Latches

For the latches, I used [these slam latches from Amazon](https://a.co/d/3nvHrYN), they're lightweight and nice quality and they've been really secure, and they're easy to open and close!

Mounting the latches is a bit tricky, I drilled the 2" hole such that the center of the hole was 1 5/8" down from the bottom of where the drawer face intersects with the bottom of the under catch support.

Figuring out how to mount the under catch support was also tricky, and often required screwing multiple times after testing. 

## Drawer slides

For the drawer slides, I used [these bottom mount drawer slides from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-20-in-Self-Closing-Bottom-Mount-Drawer-Slide-Set-1-Pair-2-Pieces-D68820E-W-W/302867524) (and I bought a variety of depths).

I did NOT use any "soft-close" ones or "ball-bearing" ones... they are surprisingly HEAVY. The weight of one of those was equivalent to the weight of all of the basic ones above!

And these basic sliders actually feel really good. And there's no need for soft close, you just "slam" the drawer and the slam latch catches it, it actually works way better than I thought!
