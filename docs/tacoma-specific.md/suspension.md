# Suspension

With the Tune M1 (500 lbs on CAT scale) plus ~250 lbs of my camper build, I was at ~850 lbs of constant load. That caused the truck to sit 2" below stock in the rear.

I installed the [Dobinsons C59-819V Coil Springs](https://dobinsonusa.com/products/dobinsons-rear-coils-for-toyota-landcruiser-300-series-c59-819v-c59-819v/) in the rear. This lifted it up 3", so that it was 1" above stock in the rear.

Their softer 817V springs would likely sit a little lower than stock with my load I think, so I think 819V was the right choice for me (I'd rather have a slight lift over stock since we go on some rough roads in Utah).

My front was sagging by 0.5" below stock, so I also [installed the Alldogs springs in the front](/blog/2025-03-13-front-lift/), which lifted the front up by 1.5", bringing it to 1" above stock in the front too.
