MPG | Date | Payload | Trip info
--|--|--|--
14.6 | 3/25/2025 | ~1600? | Vantage, 73 mph, heavy rain and windy on way there, 3 ppl
15.4 | 1/12/2025 | ~1400? | Trout Creek climbing, 2 nights, 75, 65, and 60 mph (I-90 way down and back through Portland)
16.1 | 12/30/2024 | ~1420? | Squamish overnight ski trip, 75 mph, 65 mph, and 55 mph
16.3 | 12/19/2024 | 1499 | Mostly 65 mph driving, to Smith Rock and then skiing at Hood
15.3 | 11/8/2024 | ~1391? | Mostly 75 mph driving, to Vantage and eastern WA
16.4 | 10/24/2024 | 640 | Mostly 65 mph driving, driving back from Portland after just getting the Tune installed
22.9 | 10/24/2024 | 140 (myself) | Driving down to Portland before the install

Just before getting the Tune M1, my drive down to Portland was 22.9 mpg. And then after getting it installed, the drive back up was 16.4 mpg. There might have been a little more wind on the drive home, but it seems like it's pretty reflective.

I'm kind of surpried that after installing the Tune, even when I doubled the weight, my MPG didn't really change on the 10/24 vs 12/19 trip. I wonder if the biggest factor is actually the wind resistance?
