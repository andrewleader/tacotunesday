## Quick Reference

### Front Differential

Approx 1.6 quarts of 75W-85 oil

| Bolt | Tool | Torque Spec | Crush Washer Part # |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Fill Bolt | 10mm hex bit | 29 ft‑lbs (348 in‑lbs) | 12157‑10010 |
| Drain Bolt | 10mm hex bit | 48 ft‑lbs (576 in‑lbs) | 90430‑24017 |

### Rear Differential

Approx 4.2 quarts of 75W-85 oil

|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Fill Bolt | 24mm socket | 36 ft‑lbs (432 in‑lbs) | 12157‑10010 |
| Drain Bolt | 24mm socket | 36 ft‑lbs (432 in‑lbs) | 12157‑10010 |

**Crush Washer Orientation:** Smooth side toward the differential housing; rounded/seamed side toward the bolt head.

## Required Parts

* **Gear Oil:** 75W‑85 full synthetic gear oil, **6 quarts total** for front + rear (with 6 qts, I still had extra left over)
  * **Preferred product:** [Amsoil Severe Gear 75W‑85](https://www.amsoil.com/p/amsoil-severe-gear-75w-85-100-synthetic-gear-lube-svl/)
* **Crush Washers:** (Toyota part #'s)
  * 3x: **12157‑10010** (2x for rear diff, and 1x for front fill bolt)
  * 1x: **90430‑24017** (front drain bolt)

## Required Tools

* Torque wrench that works with the 10mm hex and 24mm socket below
* Socket wrench + extensions
* Breaker wrench  that works with the 10mm hex and 24mm socket below
* **10mm hex bit** (front diff)
  * These are uncommon, your standard toolset probably doesn't have this
* **24mm socket** (rear diff)
  * These are uncommon, your standard toolset probably doesn't have this
* **12mm socket** (skid plates)
* Oil drain pan (capacity 6 qt+)
* Rags, gloves, shop towels
* Pump optional — squeeze‑pack oils worked for me
* Tools to lower spare tire (behind rear passenger seat)

## Before You Start

* Perform this on level ground.
* Warm the drivetrain with a short drive for easier draining.
* Do **not** remove a drain bolt until you confirm the **fill bolt can be loosened**.

## FRONT DIFFERENTIAL

### 1. Remove Skid Plates

* Using a **12mm** socket, remove the **8 bolts** securing the two skid plates.
  * Support the plates as you remove the final bolts—they can be awkward

### 2. Loosen Fill Bolt

* Using a **10mm hex** bit, break loose the fill bolt first
  * Always loosen the fill bolt before draining... If it’s stuck, you’d be unable to refill the diff
  * Do not fully remove it yet

### 3. Drain Oil

* Place your oil pan under the differential
* Remove the **10mm hex** drain bolt and drain into pan
  * Dark oil with metallic shimmer is normal for diff fluid.
  * Remove the fill bolt to help it drain completely

### 4. Reinstall Drain Bolt

* Clean the metal sludge off of the magnetic end of the drain bolt
* Replace the old crush washer with **#90430‑24017**
  * Verify no old washer is stuck on the housing
* Tighten the bolt to **48 ft‑lbs (576 in‑lbs)**

### 5. Fill Oil

* Add **~1.6 qt** of 75W‑85 oil in fill hole until the oil slightly weeps out
  * It can be difficult to reach the fill plug, but it's possible to use the 1 qt squeeze pouches (I used those and it worked okay) or you can use a pump

### 6. Reinstall Fill Bolt

* Replace the old crush washer with **#12157‑10010**
  * Verify no old washer is stuck on the housing
  * Place smooth side toward the differential housing; rounded/seamed side toward the bolt head
* Tighten the bolt to **29 ft‑lbs (348 in‑lbs)**

### 7. Reinstall Skid Plates

* Using a **12mm** socket, reinstall the **8 bolts** holding on the two skid plates
  * You'll start by installing the rear skid plate first
  * Torque specs are not necessary, snug them well

---

## REAR DIFFERENTIAL

### 1. Lower Spare Tire

* Remove the tool kit from behind the rear passenger seat
* Insert and rotate the tool through the rear bumper port to lower the tire fully, then slide it out


### 2. Loosen Fill Bolt

* Using a **24mm** socket, break loose the fill bolt first
  * The fill bolt is located high on the rear diff cover
  * Loosen it first to ensure that refill won't be a problem
  * Do not fully remove it yet


### 3. Drain Oil

* Place your drain pan under the differential
* Remove the **24mm** drain bolt and drain into pan
  * Expect a larger volume than the front (4+ qts)
  * Remove the fill bolt to help it drain completely


### 4. Reinstall Drain Bolt

* Clean the metal sludge off of the magnetic end of the drain bolt
* Replace the old crush washer with **#12157‑10010**
  * Verify no old washer is stuck on the housing
  * Place smooth side toward the differential housing; rounded/seamed side toward the bolt head
* Tighten the bolt to **36 ft‑lbs (432 in‑lbs)**


### 5. Fill Oil

* Add **~4.2 qt** of 75W‑85 oil in fill hole until the oil slightly weeps out
  * Fill through the upper port using squeeze packets or a pump
    * The rear diff is very easy to refill using squeeze packets
  * The correct level is reached when fluid begins to overflow the fill hole


### 6. Reinstall Fill Bolt

* Replace the old crush washer with **#12157‑10010**
  * Verify no old washer is stuck on the housing
  * Place smooth side toward the differential housing; rounded/seamed side toward the bolt head
* Tighten the bolt to **36 ft‑lbs (432 in‑lbs)**


### 7. Reinstall Spare Tire

* Slide the tire back under, align the cable, and crank it up until fully seated
  * Verify it is centered and snug

# Final Checks

* Wipe down all components and confirm no leaks.
* Dispose of old gear oil properly (O'Reilly Auto / AutoZone / etc accepts it for free)
* Test drive for several minutes, then recheck for seepage.

---

# Notes & Tips

* If a washer seems missing, it's often stuck to the housing. Remove it gently.
* You can do the entire job without lifting the truck, but lifting improves access.
* Slight metallic fuzz on magnets is normal; chunks are not.

*Your differential service is complete!*
