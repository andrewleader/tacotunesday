# Fuel range estimator on 2024 Tacoma

The fuel range estimator on the 2024 Tacoma seems to be a bit funky. Everyone agrees you can drive quite further than 0, but in addition to that it seems to decrease inconsistently. 

## Range after zero

Here's some fill up data to show how much gas is left.

## Range estimator

The range estimator seems to start accurate (like it initially said about 236 range when I started driving the stretch where I drove 236 miles, but I filled up at -8 miles for that). Then around 100 mile range it seems to drop faster than expected. But then near zero it seems to slow down.
