# Fuel range estimator on 2024 Tacoma

The fuel range estimator on the 2024 Tacoma seems to be a bit funky. Everyone agrees you can drive quite further than 0, but in addition to that it seems to decrease inconsistently. 

## Range after zero

Here's some fill up data to show how much gas is left. 

Date | Miles left to zero | Gallons filled up | MPG | Miles driven
--|--|--|--|--
1/13/2025 | -8 | 14.925 | 15.4 | 236
1/12/2025 | 2 | 13.956 | 15.3 | ?

## Range estimator

The range estimator seems to start accurate (like it initially said about 236 range when I started driving the stretch where I drove 236 miles, but I filled up at -8 miles for that). Then around 100 mile range it seems to drop faster than expected. But then near zero it seems to slow down.
