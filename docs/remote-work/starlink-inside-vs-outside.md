# Using Starlink through the Tune M1 roof

Starlink Mini test results through the roof panel vs outside: I think it's pretty equal! Key learning is that test results fluctuate a LOT, even 5 minutes apart you might get drastically different results.

I think using it inside through the roof panel at most only takes off 1 Mbps of upload. I've taken Teams calls for ~3 weeks with full video on!

Here's all my testing details, note that I list upload first since download always seems plenty fast, it's the upload that seems troublesome. Skies were mostly cloudy, but not raining.

Power draw from inside: 21w avg over last 15 mins, 99.8% ping success, 24 ms latency.

Round 1 comparison

- Inside: 10:49 AM, 1.0 Mbps up, 21 ms latency, 29.9 Mbps down
- Outside: 8 mins later (10:57 AM), 4.6 Mbps up, 37 ms latency, 107.6 Mbps down

Round 2 comparison

- Inside: 11:10 AM, 4.9 Mbps up, 20 ms latency, 95.7 Mbps down
- Outside: 5 mins earlier (11:05 AM), 11.6 Mbps up, 25 ms latency, 105.4 Mbps down

Round 3 comparison

- Inside: 11:19 AM, 7.7 Mbps up, 18 ms latency, 127.6 Mbps down
- Outside: Didn't test.

Round 4 comparison

- Inside: 2:18 PM, 10.0 Mbps up, 20 ms latency, 76.3 Mbps down
- Outside: Didn't test

For mounting it, I just temporarily used some longer t-nut bolts and put two in at opposing sides, and I'm able to place the mini up there when camping. I take it down while driving, this was just a super temporary setup to see how well it worked, but it's actually a pretty effective way of temporarily mounting it inside!
