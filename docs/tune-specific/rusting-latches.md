# Rusting latches

The exterior latches are prone to surface rust. Tune acknowledged this and is working on their own developed latches that won't rust. If yours has this problem, email them to get on their list for the new latch!

Here's what Tune themselves said on Nov 24, 2024:

> Hey everyone! A Tune customer brought this to our attention so we wanted to respond with some info. As some have mentioned, this is mostly superficial and is nothing to be concerned about, a little oil or wax will definitely help keep it at bay. Also this latch has been used widely in the camper industry for ages but it's pretty much the only thing that can rust on the M1 at this point and we weren't happy with that so we designed our own tooling and are currently stamping and powder coating a stainless steel version. For any Tune customers that would like to swap these out just reach out to Tune Customer Care and we can get you scheduled, we should get the parts in January. Also someone noted some rust on a strut? Can you please send a photo of that to Tune Customer Care so our engineers can review? Happy Camping and Happy Holidays!
