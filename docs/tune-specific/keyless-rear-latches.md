# Keyless rear latches

The stock Tune latches are a PAIN if you want to frequently lock and unlock your Tune...

So I built a keyless rear door latch! It’s automatically unlocked when your tailgate is open, and locked when the tailgate is closed, so the only key you ever need is your truck’s key!

## How it works

I bought two latches that are similar to door latches. They push closed and then hold onto the edging of the Tune to prevent it from opening. Then I ran a wire between the two latches so that when I pull on the wire, it releases both!

## How to get in

Open your truck tailgate, then with one hand in the center bottom of the Tune door, pull down on the wire and pull out at the same time. No more fumbling with keys anywhere!

## How to close/lock from the outside

Close your truck tailgate, and then just close the Tune door! It automatically latches at the end and is locked since your tailgate prevents accessing the cable/latches!

## How to close/lock from the inside

Same as outside, just grab the handle and pull the door down and closed!

## How to get out from the outside

With one hand, just pull the cable by the center handle and push out!

## Parts

- 2x latch: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MF7Z95
- 1x 3/4” thick plastic block: https://a.co/d/bYhuUIC (need enough for cutting 2x of 4 3/4” by 2 7/16”)
- 1x rubber sheet: https://a.co/d/9QAivQX (to cut 2x pieces to go behind the 3/4” blocks)
- 1x 1/4” thick plastic sheet: https://a.co/d/5bwsjle (just need enough to cut 2x pieces that are about 1.5x3”)
- 8x #6 1 1/4” wood screws (from Home Depot, for screwing in the latches and 1/4” piece behind the latch)
- 1/8” thick cable: https://a.co/d/2EKuZX2
- Foam tubing for the cable to make it comfortable to grab: https://a.co/d/hD7994W

## Tools
- Table saw
- Drill with drill bits
- Scissors
- SAE (not metric) Allen wrench
- Clamp

## General idea

You want to replace the existing latches with a door style latch. You want to make sure that nothing can be unscrewed/detached from the outside. To do this, I decided to put a plastic block on the outside that I screw into from the inside (thus the only thing visible on the outside is the block, no nuts or screws to unscrew). Then you’ll run a cable between both latches so you can pull the cable to unlatch both at the same time.

## Steps
- Remove the existing latches with an Allen wrench (SAE, not metric)
- Cut 2x of 3/4” thick block of black plastic down to 4 3/4” by 2 7/16” pieces (enough to cover the width of the old lock opening plus more toward the edge, and the height should be flush to where your glass starts). You can optionally do some edge angle cuts to make this look nicer on the outside. 
- Mark and drill the locations of the screws for your latch. Slide the Tune’s side sliding latches to their up position and position the new latch just beneath the bottom end. It should be able to go beneath and engage on the lip of the black part. Make sure it’s far enough down such that the holes will go through without touching the glass (you can always redrill, I had to). Mark and drill the holes using a drill bit bigger than the screws (the threads will go into the plastic block on the other side). 
- Cut the rubber sheet to the same size as the 3/4” thick blocks, this will go on the back to keep the opening water proof
- Place the block on the outside with the rubber sheet between it and the outside of the Tune door, then place a clamp to hold it in place. Then position your latch on the inside and screw it in. You shouldn’t need pilot holes, it self taps fine. 
- Test it out!
- With the 1/4” thick plastic, cut two pieces about 1.5” x 3” that will go to the side of the latch to cover up the other “opening” and help hold the outside block secure from the other side. Screw those on too. 
- Repeat for other side
- Then run a cable between and figure out a way to grab the cable to pull both at the same time. I wish there was a latch or something better for this, I’m sure someone could build something, especially if they have 3D printing experience.
