# Weights (payload capacity / etc)

Here's info about the payload capacity of my truck, the weight of the Tune, weight of the build, etc!

## Stock truck payload capacity

The door stickers are incorrect on the 4th gen Tacoma's (they're underrated, claiming 1,200 lbs or less). So I weighed my truck at a CAT scale.

**My actual stock payload capacity: 1,439 lbs.**

Payload is calculated as the GVWR (6,240 lbs, max your vehicle and everything in it can weigh) minus your curb weight (which is the weight of the truck with a full gas tank but nothing else in it, not even the driver).

The curb weight for my model is listed as 4,630 lbs, but my measured curb weight was 4,801 lbs, so my truck has an extra 171 lbs of extra OEM equipment.

The notable weight-impacting features my truck has are...

* Premium Package (includes moonroof, Softex seats, power seats, power tailgate, power rear window)
* Spray-on bedliner
* Stabilizer disconnect

## Weight of the Tune M1

**500 lbs**. My Tune has...

* Full rear glass window
* One glass side window
* Pass-through cab window
* MaxxAir fan

The weight did NOT include...

* Mattress (I bought my own)
* Solar panels

## Weight of my build

I haven't measured it yet, but I'm estimating **~350 lbs**.

## Payload capacity after camper

**~590 lbs** is what I'm estimating. I'll measure it sometime!
