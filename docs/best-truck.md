# Best midsize truck for a Tune M1 w/ interior build

I'm not convinced Tacoma's are best truck for the Tune if you're also building a permanent kitchen/table/etc inside of it. Midsize trucks in general struggle with these campers. The two problems with the Tacoma are...

- Its limited payload means you can at most have two people (unless you pay 10k extra for the Pro, which has a better payload capacity)
- Its small gas tank means only ~260 mile range, or even less when going 75 mph (gas mileage is severely affected)

## Payload issues

If you always travel single, you should be fine. But if you travel with another person (two people total), you’ll probably be at your payload limit with the interior build and gear and water.

If you have 3+ people, you’ll be over (unless you've emptied all your water and other non-permanent things... you can take 3 people with nothing additional, but you can't even take 4 people without being over).

With just my wife and I, and our Tune and full kitchen build, and 6 gallons of water, ski gear, rock climbing gear, and just food for 2 days, we were actually about 50 lbs over our payload capacity! 

## Range issues

The 4th gen Tacoma has an 18.2 gallon tank, so like 17 usable gallons. At stock, it gets 23 mpg on the highway, so it normally has a ~396 mile range.

However, throw on the Tune, and your highway mileage drops to like 15.5 mpg at 65 mph and 14.5 mpg at 75 mph. That means you’re looking at a range of 245-260 miles on the highway (city is actually kinda similar).

This has felt quite short for me, meaning I'm really frequently looking for gas on trips. If you have a smaller vehicle like a Subaru Crosstrek, this range feels bizarre (Crosstrek gets like 460 mile highway range, almost double!).

## 3rd gen vs 4th gen

The 4th gen is an improvement over the 3rd gen. If you’re choosing between these, definitely go 4th gen…

- 3rd gen’s payload capacity is even SMALLER.
- 3rd gen’s transmission suffers from gear hunting on the highway with this camper, 4th gen’s is flawless
- Range is probably equivalent though.

## How a Sprinter van compares

Here’s how a 2022 4x4 Sprinter van compares (144 length)…

Factor | Tacoma Off Road | Tacoma Pro | Sprinter
--|--|--|--
MSRP | 53k | 65k | 57k?
Fuel tank size | 18.2 gallons | 18.2 gallons | 24.5 gallons
Stock highway MPG | 23 | 24 | 19 stock? 17 with build?
Stock highway range | 396 | 413 | 465
Stock payload | 1,610 | 1,680 | 3,428
Payload with premium options | 1,439 | 1,680 (+241 more) | ~3,000 at least? (+1,561)

## How a Ford compares

I'm comparing off-road 4x4 capable double-cab 5' bed trucks... So the 2024 Tacoma TRD Off-Road 5' and the 2024 Ford Ranger Lariat 5', both similarly equipped with rear lockers.

Factor | Tacoma Off Road | Tacoma Pro | Ranger
--|--|--|--
MSRP | 53k | 65k | 51k (53k for 2.7L engine)
Fuel tank size | 18.2 gallons | 18.2 gallons | 18.0 gallons
Stock highway MPG | 23 | 24 | 24
Stock highway range | 396 | 413 | 408
Stock payload | 1,610 | 1,680 | 1,711 for 2.3L engine, 1,542 for 2.7L engine
Payload with premium options | 1,439 | 1,680 (+241 more) | ~1,650 (+211 more) for 2.3L engine, ~1,480 (+41) for 2.7L engine

### Premium options...

Weight-affecting premium options that were on my Tacoma...

* Premium Package (includes moonroof, Softex seats, power seats, power tailgate, power rear window)
* Spray-on bedliner (40 lbs?)
* Stabilizer disconnect

Additional Ranger Lariat items I added to be equivalent were...

* Rear locker (10 lbs?)
* Off road package (shocks? 10 lbs?)
* Spray-on bedliner (40 lbs?)
