# Paint / Sealing

## Paint

For painting the cabinets/seats, we first sanded the wood with 220 grit sandpaper, then put a coat of white trim paint, and then two coats of cabinet paint.

## Counter / table seal

The countertop and table are both 1/2" plywood. We filled any holes in the edges with wood filler and then sanded with 220 grit and rounded the corners. Then we put some stain on, and then did about 7 coats of polyurethane sealer. It required more coats than we thought to get a decent finish.
