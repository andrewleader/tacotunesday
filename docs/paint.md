# Paint / Sealing

## Paint

For painting the cabinets/seats, we first sanded the wood with 220 grit sandpaper, then put a coat of white trim paint, and then two coats of cabinet paint.

## Counter / table seal

The countertop and table are both 1/2" plywood. We filled any holes in the edges with wood filler and then sanded with 220 grit and rounded the corners. Then we put some stain on, and then did about 7 coats of polyurethane sealer. The polyurethane sealer didn't seem to work well on plywood though... it would still let moisture through, water wasn't properly beading up on it. Eventually we epoxied the table and countertop... we slightly sanded the existing polyurethane with 220 grit, and then applied a single coat of TotalBoat Table Top Epoxy. Now they're perfect! See the vid below for the end result.
