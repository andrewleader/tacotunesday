title: Fixing my noisy Seaflo water pump

I have the [Seaflo 21 Series water pump](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DLKT4OO) in my camper, connected to a LiFePO4 battery (which is up to 14.4V when fully charged or charging), and it was NOISY. It sounded like a jackhammer.

[On Reddit, ihaveavanquestion pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/mb5pvo/comment/grzcrk2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that you can use these pumps at different voltages, and the manual did confirm this too, and it was right! It's significantly quieter running at 10.0V, and still has plenty of water pressure!

This is the DC Buck Converter I purchased: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Q1624B

It has high enough amp output for the water pump, and is adjustable, and works well with my existing power switch (it remembers what it's set to when I turn my power switch off, and when I switch my switch on, it comes back to the same voltage I previously set).
