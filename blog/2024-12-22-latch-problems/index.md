The Tune M1 door/window latches aren't my favorite. There's two problems...

First, the key is really tough to get in and out. Our Tune is only 2 months old, and the keys are always a struggle to get in and out. It's nowhere near as smooth as a car key or a house key. As seen in the video, I really had to work to pull it out!

Second, when you're trying to lock it, the latch always ends up opening, since you need to push the key into the same thing that you push to open the latch!

Luckily I rarely use these side window latches so I just always keep them locked, and I swapped my rear door one for some keyless latches. If I kept the stock latches on the rear door (which I use and need to keep locked when I'm parked), I'd go crazy!
