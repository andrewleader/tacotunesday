We've owned our Tune M1 for 1 year, we've driven over 20,000 miles, and spent over 80 nights in it, including a 6-week-long remote working trip. Let's review what we love about it, and what could be better!

## Why We Chose the Tune Over a Camper Van

First, let's talk about why we chose the Tune over a camper van.

**Number 1 - Off-road capability.** We go to some really remote trailheads that require true 4x4. Sprinter vans just aren't built for that. Even the more capable ones still wouldn't be as capable, or as reliable, as a Tacoma.

**Number 2 - Ability to transport more than 2 people.** Occasionally, it's nice to be able to bring a friend or two, and the short length sprinter vans rarely fit 4 passengers without compromising space.

Now, you do sacrifice a lot by choosing a truck camper over a van… it's not as good in the rain, it takes time to set up and close, it's tougher to get in and out of, you can't stealth camp in it, and it's annoying having two separate places to store things… we'll often forget something in the front and have to open the tailgate, crawl out, walk around, grab it, and crawl back in.

So if you don't do true off roading (I'm talking real 4-lo rock crawling) and you don't need to transport 4 people, I'd get a van. But for us, the Tune M1 has been the right choice!

## What Makes the Tune the Best Pop Up Truck Camper

So what makes the Tune the best pop up truck camper? The extra width inside meant we could build a large kitchen/table setup that's worked well for remote working, and the sleeping setup means one person can stay in bed while the other person has full access to the kitchen.

## Durability and Build Quality

The durability and build quality of the Tune has been quite fantastic, and it's holding up well. Opening and closing it is as good as day one. However, there have been two issues:

### Issue #1: Water Resistance

**Waterproof-ness.** All fabric-based popups probably struggle with this. The main issue is that when you close the camper while it's still wet, some of that water on the outside fabric ends up seeping through while it's closed, getting a little water on our mattress and our countertops. It's not a ton of water, but if you regularly camped in the rain, it'd be annoying. We're fair weather campers, so it's not too big of a deal for us. We also had one major water leak while the camper was closed, but the Tune shop fixed that for us. We've had no issues driving in the rain or leaving it parked in the rain, only the small issue when camping popped up in the rain.

### Issue #2: Interior Lights

**The interior lights.** The interior lights are super great and elegant, but the wiring is a little flaky… we've had a front light temporarily go out, and then our side light has permanently gone out. The connecting wires are to blame, and will require me re-soldering the connections. Multiple Tune owners have had this same issue.

Other than that, the Tune has been quite issue-free!

## Annoying Aspects

While we've loved our Tune, there are some annoying aspects:

**Two separate spaces.** The biggest annoyance applies to any truck campers—the fact that you have two separate spaces means that you'll forget things in the front, or want something from the back, and it's more time consuming to go out there and grab it.

**Popping up and down.** Popping up and down the camper is also time consuming, which is especially annoying if you just want to spend a couple hours somewhere or just drive down a mile to the bathroom.

**Condensation.** One minor thing we've noticed is condensation issues on the ceiling when camping in colder and more humid locations. Insulating the ceiling might be worth it, the panels are condensation magnets.

## Our Interior Build

While we're inside, let's talk about our interior build. We built this for my wife and I to go on extended trips for up to 6 weeks at a time, including remotely working. We wanted a nice kitchen setup since we cook a bit, so we went with:

- An induction stove
- A nice sized sink and faucet
- A 30 liter drawer fridge
- Slam latch drawers to easily store and access our utensils and food

This setup has been perfect, and everything's stayed closed even when off roading!

## Would We Choose a Tune Again?

So, would we choose a Tune again? **The answer is yes.** While we are occasionally envious of vans and would appreciate the ease of getting in and out, and having everything in one space, we've really appreciated going to truly remote places where a van can't make it, like [The Maze District in Canyonlands](/blog/maze-district-stats). We're looking forward to another year of amazing remote campsites in our Tune!
