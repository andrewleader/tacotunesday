The [Digital Rearview Mirror Camera Redirect from GG Offroad](https://www.ggoffroad.com/store/p/digital-rearview-camera-relocation-kit-tundra-22-24-tacoma-24-psdz8) seems to be having some issues with the heat.

Whenever it's sunny and 70 degrees or warmer outside, the digital mirror will start flashing black like seen below roughly every 15-30 seconds.

It's 100% related to the heat, it's not caused by bumpy roads or anything. I've been monitoring this problem for a month, and it 100% corresponds with the heat. I've even added a basic sun shade to the camera, but if we're driving downhill it doesn't block the sun and will start overheating / etc.
