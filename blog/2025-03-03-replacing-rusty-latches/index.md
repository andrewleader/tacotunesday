Tune made some new rust-proof latches! If you have the old style and have surface rust, contact their customer support. The newer Tune's already ship with these. They shipped out a new set of latches to me for free, including shipping the rivet gun necessary to replace it. They would have also worked with me to get them replaced if I didn't want to do it myself! Great customer service!
