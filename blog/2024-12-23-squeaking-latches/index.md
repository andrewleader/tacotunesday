Many people notice a super subtle, high-pitched squeak from their Tune M1 when going over bumps or even closing their car doors.

These squeaks often come from the window latches, since they're metal-on-metal.

It's a simple fix to just put some foam tape on the metal backplate (or soft velcro or anything else to cushion the metal backplate). Then, no more squeaks!

I used this foam tape: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V1JMN2G

Others have simply used soft velcro tape they had on hand (I happened to have extra of that foam tape I used).
